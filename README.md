# Canparam
A simple package for reading in parameters and writing out templates.

## Usage
An example is provided and can be run with

    python3 ./example.py

The package functionality can easily be extended by adding python files to the `context` directory with names corresponding to keys in the `template.dat` file.

Any corrections or improvements are welcome!
